# Steam Wishlist

A backend-focused website designed to store games and users in a database.

Hosted at:
https://steam-wishlist-app.dev.andrew-alsing.me/

Status page:
https://stats.uptimerobot.com/QlO3QTBogM

## To run the app locally, you'll need to either clone this repository or run docker and run the following commands:

Install dependencies:

```bash
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Run app:

```bash
python3 app.py
```

OR

Docker:

```bash
docker compose up
```

## Fetures I'd like to add:

- User generated tags that can be assigned to games
- API request to generate a game library database
- Comments and ratings

# Steam Wishlist
A backend-focused website designed to store games and users in a database.

## To run the app locally, you'll need to clone this repository and run the following commands:
Install dependencies:
```
pip3 install -r requirements.txt
```

Run app:
```
python3 app.py
```

## Fetures I'd like to add:
- User generated tags that can be assigned to games
- API request to generate a game library database
- Comments and ratings
